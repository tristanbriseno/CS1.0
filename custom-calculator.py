temperature = float(input("Please enter temperature in fahrenheit:"))
#this is where the code asks the user for iput
#it then uses the input as a float and substitutes "temperature" in the formula down below with the number provided.
celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5 / 9
print("The temperature in celsius is: " , celsius)
#the code will then print the result of the conversion process and return the answer to you
