# custom-calculator
# My custom calculator calculates a persons BMI by asking the users hight I'm meters and weight in kilograms. It then uses these two assigned values and runs this formula (weight/height x height). it will then print the result of the calculation to you.
# In this project, I used Python version 3.8.2.
